# Case-Study-Analyzing_Customer_Churn_in_PowerBI
In this Project, I will be investigating a dataset from a telecom company called "Databel" and my task is to analyze the churn rate. Churn rate simply means the rate at which customers leave a company. That is, they no longer have connect with the company.

# Data analysis flow in PowerBI
There are five different steps in the data analysis flow
* Data Check
* Explore Data
* Analyze and visualize data.
* Dashboarding
* Commuicating insights.

These steps will be exercised in this project.
