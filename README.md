# Case-Study-Analyzing_Customer_Churn_in_PowerBI
In this Project, I investigated a dataset from a telecom company called "Databel" and my task is to analyze the churn rate. Churn rate simply means the rate at which customers leave a company. That is, they no longer do business with the company.

# Data analysis flow in PowerBI
There are five different steps in the data analysis flow
* Data Check
* Explore Data
* Analyze and visualize data.
* Dashboarding
* Commuicating insights.

These steps were exercised in this project.

## Data Check/Validation
First, i checked the data on customers. In this process i checked for missing values of customers Id. from the page below, it is observed that in comparing both the total number of customers and the total number of unique customers(records without duplicates or empty records) are equal. This means the Data is complete.
Next, i calculated the ratio of churned cutomers and the data shows Databel had 26% of customers who are churned.

#### Investigating Churn reasons
Next, i investigated the reason why customers churned. I created visuals to properly presented the information needed.
This visual was created using the **"customer reason"** column and **"Number of Customers"** column.
From the chart, of the list of reasons customers churned, "competitors made better offers" was the most reason. This means that on the records, This means that Databel had competitors who could attract its customers with offers that seemed better that Databel's.

## Explore Data
#### Deeper investigation on churn categories
The **"churn reason"** column was grouped in the **"churn category"** column.

#### Using Maps
I visualized the the churn rate across different states in the the Unied State. It turns out, Databel had the most churned rate in **"California"** was abnormally high at **68%**. This investigation helps trace where the Databel is losing customers.

## Analyzing Demographics
This visual reveals the Age Group that has churned the most having a 36% churn Rate.

#### Inspecting Groups
An analogy here was that Databel offers group contract to customers in the same household. The advanteage for the customer is a discount rate in purchases, which is a good way to grow your customer base.
i went further to check if customers in a group have a lower phone bill, and if this affected the churn rate.
From the visual below, the data shows that group category 6 has the lowest churn rate of **6.71%**.
